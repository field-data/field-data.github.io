## Tutorial description


Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and understanding language universals as it provides the only uncontested way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of human languages. Field linguistics is blind to the languages' prestigiousness, thus providing data for unprivileged languages. Because of typolocial diversity interests, languages referenced by the field linguistic research, are often low-resourced.

The Field Data Tutorial is meant to provide NLP practitioners with the notion of how to get the new language data processed in the modern field linguistic workflow. 
The tutorial overviews a complete fieldwork pipeline, with a special focus on NLP-enhancable stages of pipeline. 
As a result of the tutorial, we expect the attendees to perceive the hands-on experience with the pure linguistic data, and an understanding of what the NLP challenges with the field linguistics are.


## Tutorial programme 

While the exact programme is TBD , we provide the expected programme overview below.

### Expected Agenda
The tutorial consists of two subparts, with the slightly larger amount of time dedicated to the latter one. Starting with an introductional talk on the fieldwork, attendees are to discuss its key problems. Then, a hands-on experience of working with the field data is planned.
#### Part One: introduction to the fieldwork
This part is smaller, compared to the second one. In this part, the tutorial team will give an introductory talk on the fieldwork and Field NLP automation techniques, supplemented by audio- and video- materials from the 2021-2022 fieldwork.

#### Part Two: hands-on experience
in this part, the attendees will practise several milestone stages of the fieldwork pipeline.
While following the up-to-day conventional methodology, attendees will also discuss and give a try to SotA NLP technologies automation techniques.
The discussion of these techniques is, in fact, the main point of the whole tutorial.

## Target Auditory

Our target auditory are modern NLP practitioners curious about the low-resource challenges similar to the ones proposed in [SIGTYP](https://sigtyp.github.io/) and [SIGMORPHON](https://sigmorphon.github.io/) Shared Tasks.
We also welcome low-Resourc NLP practitioners who have no or minor experience with the fieldwork.

The tutorial is hardly perceivable for students with no programming experience.

We expect approximately 20 participants to attend the tutorial directly, and also plan to provide the recorded live-stream to allow for broader audience to attend.
    
The direct attendees will be chosen via the tutorial registration form. The organizers will ensure that the direct attendees represent the diverse levels of linguistic/NLP proficiency as well as different social groups. This will ease the tutorial comprehension for the larger body of possible live-stream attendees.


## Anti-Harassment Policy
Field Data 2022 adheres to the [ACL Anti-Harassment Policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/sphp?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy).

## Demographic Diversity
We encourage diversity in all forms. 
Tutorial organizers make it their top priority the freedom of thought and expression, as well as respectful scientific debate. 
On behalf of the organizing team, we are committed to the principles of gender and sociodemographic diversity and are guided by these principles in the consideration of the tutorial team.
